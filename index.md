Hi there! My name is Richard Moch, a programmer who specializes in failure and barely functional code.

### Who I am

I was born on March 29, 2003 and I have always had an extreme... _interest_ in programming and just about to do with computers. I've recently (ish) been involving myself in video editing and have gained a small following on places such as my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/FloppyDiskDriveVideos).

## What I'm doing

I'm an official dev in [Bit Phoenix Software](https://bitphoenixsoftware.com) as well as a community moderator. All in all, I'm pretty much trying to round out my portfolio for programming.

I've also been very much involved in school activities, namely show choir, programming (yay!), as well as computer repair and German. I'm not sure how much that'll help
me in the real world, aber ich werde immer Spa√ü machen!

## Wanna get in touch?

You can visit my [software page](/software) for the stuff I write, or if you're so inclined, take a look at my [blog posts](/posts) if you want a glimpse into my mind.

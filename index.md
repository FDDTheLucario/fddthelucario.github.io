## Richard Moch

Hi there! My name is Richard Moch, a programmer who specializes in failure and barely functional code.

I was born on March 29, 2003 and I have always had an extreme... _interest_ in programming and just about to do with computers. I've recently (ish) been involving myself in video editing and have gained a small following on places such as my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/FloppyDiskDriveVideos).

I'm also an official dev in [Bit Phoenix Software](https://bitphoenixsoftware.net) as well as a community moderator. All in all, I'm pretty much trying to round out my portfolio for programming.

You can visit my [software page](/software) for the stuff I write, or if you're so inclined, take a look at my [blog posts](/posts) if you want a glimpse into my mind.

Ich lerne auch Deutsch in der Schule!
